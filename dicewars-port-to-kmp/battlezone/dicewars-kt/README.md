# Motivations and inspiration

I enjoyed playing a quick game of [Dice Wars](https://www.chrisraff.com/dicewars/), but eventually I became frustrated with how unbalanced
the gameplay is. For example in 1 vs 1 games the player who attacks first has a huge advantage.

I also wanted to make the game more challenging by improving the abysmal play level of the bots.
In future versions there will be support for high speed bot tournaments, so that the play level
of the bots can be evaluated.

To speed up implementation the initial map generation and rendering code was translated by Claude Code from Chris Raff's javascript version https://github.com/chrisraff/dicewarsjs.

The code has been written in AI engineering mode, using Claude Code, or Codex.

## Gameplay

Players compete to control all territories on a hexagonal board by rolling dice to attack adjacent enemy territories.
The player with the higher dice total wins each battle. Armies are reinforced each round based on territories controlled.

- **2–8 players** (human and/or bots)
- **Dice-based combat**: compare totals to determine the winner
- **Turn-based or real-time** modes.
- **Procedurally generated** hex maps

### Game Flow

1. Select game mode: Human vs Bot or Bot vs Bot
2. Select player count (2–8)
3. Attack adjacent enemy territories or skip your turn
4. When all active players skip, armies are reinforced
5. Last player controlling all territories wins
